nextjs-3d-force-graph-impl
==========================

An implementation of 3d [react-force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/react-force-graph) in a [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) App Router application and also uses some components directly from [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js).

Serves as an example of combining various features of react-force-graph-3d + manipulating Three.js Camera, Controls and Scene. Additionally, uses some simple [tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss), includes a few buttons that dynamically interact with the graph and make use of useCallback, useEffect, useRef and useState [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) components.
