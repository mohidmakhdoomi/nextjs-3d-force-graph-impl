# lessons-critical.md — Always-On Engineering Wisdom (HOT tier)

<!-- HOT tier: capped lessons + a bounded map of lessons-learned.md. Always injected into
every porch phase prompt and into CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md. CAP: <=10 lessons, <=12 map topics,
<=35 lines. To add a lesson, DEMOTE a weaker one into lessons-learned.md (displacement).
MAINTAIN polices the cap and keeps the map in sync with lessons-learned.md's sections.
STARTER: a few universal lessons are seeded; add your project's as you learn them. -->

## Critical lessons (consult before deciding)
- Check for existing work (PRs, git history) before building from scratch.
- "It compiled" / "tests pass" is not "it works" — verify the real user path before calling it done.
- When stuck (2 failed hypotheses or ~30 min), get an outside perspective instead of guessing.
- Before consultation, ensure every new deliverable is included in the canonical review diff; untracked files are invisible to reviewers.
